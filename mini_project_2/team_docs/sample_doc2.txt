Hello Team,

I wanted to share some important information about how we work together to keep things running smoothly.

We follow agile practices, which means we have daily stand-up meetings every morning at 9 AM to sync up on progress and blockers.

All code changes go through mandatory reviews to maintain quality, and we use Git with feature branches to manage our work.

Communication is mostly through Slack and email, so please keep an eye on those channels.

New team members get a two-week onboarding to get up to speed with our tools and processes.

We prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance, and we keep our documentation updated in Confluence.

Security is a top priority, so we regularly scan our code and follow best practices.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!

Best,
Project Manager
