Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating 
systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks 
include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that can 
learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build 
mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.

There are three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled training data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through interaction with environment

Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to 
model and understand complex patterns in data.
